Primetime
=========

Goal: Use Golang to find primes.

## Usage

```sh
# Find 100 primes.
go run primetime.go

# Find 3000 primes.
go run primetime.go -nth=3000
```

The first time this program runs, a new file will be created: `data.txt`. This file will have new primes appended to it, one per line, as they are found.
